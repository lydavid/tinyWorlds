Ideas (assuming we want to follow the theme)

- game where you can transition from large state and small state to solve various puzzles
- literal translation of the theme we can make a game that involves small worlds like bacteria community lol
- game where you can shoot and the stuff you shoot is tiny and goes into places idk
    -your bullets turns victim tiny
    -tiny victims in turn can shoot you and make you tiny
    -after a period of time, you return to your normal size
    -while tiny, you have some advantages such as hiding in small holes and sniping big targets but be careful since when
    the target is reduced below a certain amount of HP, they too turn tiny, then you can have a final brawl as mini-dudes.
    -the game would be a FPS or Third-Person Shooter and maps might include a household kitchen
